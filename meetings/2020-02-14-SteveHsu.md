title: "Provenance-Guided Synthesis of Datalog Programs"
speaker: "Steve Hsu"
semester: "SP20"

I will speak this Friday at PL club about this paper
(https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mhnaik/papers/popl20.pdf),
"Provenance-Guided Synthesis of Datalog Programs," which I read
recently for an independent study. This paper gives a approach for
synthesizing a Datalog program from input-output examples. The
approach uses a Datalog solver to determine why a candidate program
produces an undesired output ("why" provenance), and its key insight
is that we can determine why a candidate program fails to produce a
desired output ("why not" provenance). My goal for this talk is to
improve my understanding of the paper.

Homework:
1) look at some examples of Datalog syntax
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog)
2) learn about counterexample-guided inductive synthesis, the paradigm
this paper uses for synthesis; section 2.2 of this paper
(https://www.kroening.com/papers/cav2018-synthesis.pdf) gives an
overview
