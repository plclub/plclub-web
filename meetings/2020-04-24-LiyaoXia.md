We will discuss defunctionalization, a programming
technique which is amazingly simple and powerful. I will talk about its
origins (a paper by John Reynolds in 1972 [1], and also the precursor
idea of closures, in a paper by Peter Landin in 1964 [2]), and then
present some applications, possibly with a more PL bent than the
homework below.


Homework:

a. (Long-ish) A practical introduction to defunctionalization is the
following talk, which comes with a transcript, and is a lot of fun even
if you're already familiar with the topic:

     "The Best Refactoring You've Never Heard Of" by James Koppel (2019)

b. (Short) A condensed version appeared as a post on the SIGPLAN blog:

     "Defunctionalization: Everybody Does It, Nobody Talks About It" by
James Koppel (2019)

(Optional) If you have more time, this paper has a great collection of
detailed examples:
