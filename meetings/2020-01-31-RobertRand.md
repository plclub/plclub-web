Quantum programs are hard to write, hard to run and hard to test. In this talk, we show how techniques from programming languages, formal verification and compilation can allow us to write quantum programs that are as reliable as the given hardware allows. This provides a path towards writing reliable software for quantum computers, both as we envision them in twenty years and as they exist today.
